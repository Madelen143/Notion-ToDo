Notes:
Created ToDo.js file
installed Node.js to be able to run JS

ToDo file did not run since did not have @notionhq/client package installed

created a package.json file using "npm init"
	package.json file has info on project like version number, packages needed and author

installed @notionhq/client by running "npm install @notionhq/client --save" 
	"--save" flag saves the package as dependency in package.json file

Could not access env vars so added require line in ToDo.js
ran "npm install dotenv --save" to save as dependency

Notion Page ID = 32 characters after "www.notion.so/"
When query db, get response back for Status col
  	Status: { id: 'rMdI', name: 'Status', type: 'checkbox', checkbox: {} }
But to create filed in js async call:
	'Status' : {'checkbox' : false}

Refer to https://developers.notion.com/reference/page-property-values
to see how to format entries
